Rugby data scraping and analysis

## The repo's structure
The repo is split into 3 directories: scripts, data & visuals. Initially, both the data & visuals directories are empty and are filled by the outputs of the python scripts in the scrpits directory. That scripts in the directory should be ran in the following order:
1) scripts/rwc_2023/data_scraping.py
2) scripts/rwc_2023/player_name_matchup.py
3) scripts/rwc_2023/player_scoring.py
Note: There's an additional script named *useful_functions.py* which contains functions that'll be used across the other python scripts.
